            <b>Icon, brought to perfection.</b>
            Volkswagen celebrates the 50th anniversary of the Golf model. 
            Serial production of the best-selling Volkswagen model began in Wolfsburg in March 1974. 
            Since then, more than 37 million vehicles have been produced after that first Golf model. 
            Purely mathematically speaking, this means that every day for the past 50 years, more than 2000 people worldwide have decided to buy a new Golf. 
            This compact icon makes it the most successful European vehicle and the best-selling Volkswagen model of all time. 
            Volkswagen now presents the latest phase in the evolution of the Golf model with a completely new developed infotainment system and the next generation plug-in hybrid drive. 
            This spring, the best Golf of the last 50 years arrives in car dealerships.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <b>New light design.</b> The new Golf and Golf Variant are recognizable by their modified front end. 
            Features that visually define them include the Volkswagen logo², which is illuminated for the first time on European markets, and newly designed LED headlights. 
            In the top variant IQ.LIGHT LED matrix headlights², new powerful high beams with a range of up to 500 m are included. IQ.LIGHT 3D LED taillights² 
            in both body variants are also newly designed.

        <h1>Most succesful Volkswagen model</h1>
        <img src="https://cf-cdn-v6.volkswagen.at/media/Abstract_Image_B960_Component.Content_SimpleMedia_Image_Component/38826-458377_3864-content-1273858-933426-1273859-child-b960/dh-1017-c2426a/c1b5a73a/1700724205/db2023au01063-large-min.jpg" alt="Tiguan image">
        <p>
            <b>Best-selling SUV.</b> Currently, the most successful model of the Volkswagen brand worldwide is the Tiguan. 
            In just the last two years, Volkswagen has produced 1.2 million units. Since its introduction in 2007, more than 7.5 million customers have chosen this SUV. 
            As part of its world premiere, Volkswagen introduces the completely redesigned Tiguan, marking the third generation of its best-selling model. With the new Tiguan model, 
            significant changes to the T-Cross, ID.4, ID.5, and Touareg from 2023, 
            the Taigo model introduced in late 2021, enhanced versions of the T-Roc from 2022, and numerous international models such as the Atlas, Tayron, 
            and ID.6, Volkswagen's SUV lineup is one of the most modern and extensive offerings in the market.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Expressive design.</b> The first generation of the Tiguan SUV combined confident styling with the typical charming character of Volkswagen vehicles. 
            This style is also evident in the new Tiguan. Based on the successful DNA of the Tiguan model, a completely new design was created - typical for Tiguan, typical for Volkswagen, 
            yet entirely new. A prominent feature is the higher front end for a more powerful look, integrating new flat LED headlights. Between them, 
            a horizontal strip covered with glass and an additional integrated LED strip replaces the traditional radiator grille. The actual radiator grille openings are 
            integrated into the bumper. Air curtains on the outer sides of the bumper ensure optimal airflow direction. The front end of clean design emphasizes 
            the fact that the coefficient of drag has been improved from 0.33 to 0.28. Sports shoulder elements above the wheel arches dominate the vehicle's silhouette. 
            Wheels are available up to 20 inches in size. A new horizontal LED strip accentuates the recognizable rear of the Tiguan model.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Modern cockpit design.</b> Volkswagen has completely redesigned the interior of the Tiguan model. With high-quality materials and craftsmanship, 
            optional details such as decorative stitching and contrasting accents on surfaces break the conventional boundaries of the class. 
            More than ever, the new Tiguan resembles a compact sibling to the luxury Touareg model. Additionally, MIB4 platform components blend into the new cockpit design - intuitive to operate, consistently integrated, 
            with a clean and smart design. Modules include a new digital cockpit (digital instruments with an anti-glare coating in horizontal orientation), a large infotainment screen with a completely new menu structure and graphics, a new head-up display (projections on the windshield), 
            and a new multifunctional switch for driving experience with an integrated OLED display. With the new voice assistant IDA, vehicle and infotainment functions, such as sound volume, are easily controlled with natural speech. 
            The driving experience switch, IDA, and logically structured infotainment system menu are examples of the new control structure of the Tiguan model.
