                    <h3>Space and practicality</h3>
                    <p>
                        Getting a comfortable driving position is easy in the Volkswagen Golf. 
                        All models get height-adjustable front seats with lumbar adjustment and the steering wheel also has a wide range of adjustments for height and reach.
                        Want your Golf to take the edge of winter? 
                        Then consider the winter pack which adds heated seats, a heated steering wheel, a quick clear heated windscreen and heated washer jet nozzles that will not freeze.
                        There is not much wrong with the cars interior storage. 
                        All models have large bins in each door, they are felt-lined to stop things jiggling about a decent-sized glovebox and a small storage space under the front-centre armrest.

                    <h3>Performance</h3>
                    <b><h5>In town</h5></b>
                    <p>
                        The Volkswagen Golf is easy to drive in town. 
                        You get good all-around visibility, light steering, a clutch pedal that is not too springy and brakes that are progressive, not snatchy.
                        The manual gearbox is a little bit notchy, but there is always the option to go for the seven-speed automatic.
                        It shifts gear smoothly once you are underway, but can be slightly jerky at slow speeds which you will notice when parking. 
                        Otherwise, the Golf is an easy car to park. 
                        All models come with progressive steering that has not much more than one turn lock-to-lock, front and rear parking sensors and the optional auto-park system can park the Golf in bays and perpendicular spaces. 
                        It can even nose you into gaps if it needs to.
                    </p>
                    <b><h5>On the motorway</h5></b>
                    <p>
                        The Volkswagen Golf is very relaxing for a car this size when you get up to speed on the motorway with comfortable suspension and a quiet cabin that is only spoiled by a little flutter of wind from around the wing mirrors.
                        All models come with active cruise control that can accelerate and brake the car automatically. 
                        It works best when paired with the Golf's automatic gearbox, which means the car can come to a complete stop with no outside interference.
                        Matrix LEDs are another option worth considering. 
                        They have multiple separate LEDs that can be controlled individually so they don not blind other road users while keeping the area around them fully illuminated.
                    </p>
                    <b><h5>On a twisty road</h5></b>
                    <p>
                        Volkswagen has even managed to make the Golf fun to drive in corners. 
                        It grips well and putting the car in Sport mode makes the steering heavier, sharpens the throttle and (in cars with adjustable dampers) stiffens the suspension.

                    <b><h3>Interior style, infotainment and accessories</h3></b>
                    <p>
                        The Volkswagen Golf may have a conservative look on the outside, but inside iti s modern and avant-garde. 
                        All models come with a large centre touchscreen that is supported by another digital display behind the steering wheel where you would expect to find analogue dials. 
                        Quality is good with smart trims and plenty of squidgy plastics.
                        Where you used to find knobs and buttons in a Golf, the new model now has touch-sensitive sliders for the ventilation system and stereo, while you can make use of the system gesture controls by karate chopping the air to swipe through menus.
                        The result of having no buttons is that the Golfs interior has a clean minimal look and you get colourful ambient lighting fitted as standard.
