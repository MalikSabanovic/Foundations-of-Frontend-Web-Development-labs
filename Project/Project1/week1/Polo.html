                    <p>
                        <b>It might look small on the outside, but the Volkswagen Polo is impressively roomy on the inside. The boots very spacious too</b>
                        The latest Volkswagen Polo is much more spacious inside than the old model. It is so spacious in fact that it runs the larger VW Golf very close in terms of outright roominess.
                        There is loads of space in the front and plenty of adjustment to help you get comfy, even if you are tall. 
                        All the controls are within easy reach and it is dead easy to tweak the steering wheel position to give you a good view of the digital instrument display. 
                        Things are just as roomy in the back seats.

                    <h3>Performance</h3>
                    <b><h5>In town</h5></b>
                    <p>
                        The Volkswagen Polo is easy to drive around town thanks to its light steering and good visibility. 
                        The relatively slim pillars do not block your view out at junctions and its large rear windscreen helps make parking a doddle, too.
                        Even in models with larger alloy wheels you will not be shaken too much by monster potholes and it does not lean excessively in tight corners either. 
                        The seven-speed automatic gearbox can be a little jerky at lower speeds so is not ideal for parking. Speaking of which, there are plenty of driver assistance options, including parking assist. 
                        So even if you are prone to parallel parking anxiety, you will soon find it a breeze.
                    </p>
                    <b><h5>On the motorway</h5></b>
                    <p>
                        At motorway speeds, the Polo does a good job of muting both wind and tyre noise and it feels impressively stable for a small car. 
                        The mid and top-range engines have good punch so are good for overtaking on the motorway, although you will struggle with the entry level non-turbo petrol. 
                        The five-speed manual gearbox is rather frustrating on the motorway as it could definitely do with an extra gear. 
                        Unfortunately a six-speed manual is no longer available. 
                        All models include cruise control though, and you can even upgrade to adaptive cruise control for easier motorway miles.
                    </p>
                    <b><h5>On a twisty road</h5></b>
                    <p>
                        The Polo is stable nature does mean you will feel confident on twisty roads. 
                        Sports suspension is available as an option, but it is rather unnecessary and you might as well go for the Polo GTi.
                        The manual gearbox is precise and feels amazing. Overall, the Polo definitely feels competent and easy to drive.

                        <b>The Volkswagen Polo has a smart, upmarket cabin and feels impressively well built for such a compact car.</b> 
                        The Volkswagen Polo interior is a huge step up from the old cars rather drab affair. 
                        Almost every surface you will regularly touch (and plenty you will not) comes with a soft squidgy finish and all the controls feel just as solid.
                        Every Volkswagen Polo comes with a touchscreen infotainment display nestled neatly in a glossy black bezel on the dashboard.
